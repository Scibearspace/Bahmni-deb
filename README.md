# Bahmni-deb

This is essentially a fork of the [Bahmni-package](https://github.com/Bahmni/bahmni-package) with a focus on creating Deb packages.

This is the public version of the repostory.

You can use this as a the base point if you wish to contribute.

In terms of development I have a repo on [GitLab]:https://gitlab.com/davem for my personal changes, (access available if you so desire).

However this public repo will represent a mirror of that [Bahmni-Deb-Package](https://gitlab.com/davem/Bahmni-Deb-Package), eventually I will create a release branch over there and this will become the mirror to this repository. In the first instance however the 2 repositories will be the same as I expect only I will be contributing !

In the above manner I can keep things nice and clean between this main location and the 'unreviewed development', hence code can be reviewed over there before it becomes truly public over here.
